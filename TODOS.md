# Todos:

- IMMEDIATELY: fetch with country: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=YOUR_APP_ID.
  make a header component which is always on the page, like pokedex.
  think of ways to include country on the search. might need autocomplete on the input for this. if can't find a way to make user add the country on a simple way just remove it

- add the imperial/metric toggle
- carbon copy the app design. use excalidraw font, either find fitting icons or draw them and use them
- light/dark theme toggle (need to change icons color too, scrap this if it's not possible)
- add auto completion on the text input
