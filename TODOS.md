# User stories:

- a user can type the name of a city in a text input
- after choosing a city, the app will display the current weather for the city, along with additional information, and the forecast for the next few days
- a user can toggle between imperial and metric system

# If possible:

- background changes with the current weather, like mobile weather apps
- the text input has auto completion

# IMPORTANT!:

- dont let the user break the app by spamming or typing when they shouldnt. react query has options like isLoading and whatnot to disable
- can use current time and sunrise/set to calculate if it's day or night time
- try to find better icons
- instead of pop, show time in the chosen city
