# User stories:

- a user can type the name of a city in a text input
- after choosing a city, the app will display the current weather for the city, along with additional information, and the weather for the next few days
- a user can toggle the temperature between celsius and fahrenheit

# If possible:

- background changes with the current weather (something nice, not a crap static photo like the one before)
- the text input has auto completion
