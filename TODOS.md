# Todos:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- add the imperial/metric toggle
- carbon copy the app design. use excalidraw font, either find fitting icons or draw them and use them
- light/dark theme toggle (need to change icons color too, scrap this if it's not possible)
- add auto completion on the text input
=======
- a user can type the name of a city in a text input
- after choosing a city, the app will display the current weather for the city, along with additional information, and the forecast for the next few days
- a user can toggle between imperial and metric system

# If possible:

- background changes with the current weather, like mobile weather apps
- the text input has auto completion

# IMPORTANT!:

- dont let the user break the app by spamming or typing when they shouldnt. react query has options like isLoading and whatnot to disable
- find better icons
- forecast returns an array with days, can do small cards to show the weather for x days
- instead of pop, show time in the chosen city (api returns timezone)
