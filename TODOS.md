- IMMEDIATELY: fetch with country: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=YOUR_APP_ID.

  !!!! cities with a space bar are just put like that on the url, check fetchCity, see what you're fetching, check how to fix it in the url, etc

  think of ways to include country on the search. might need autocomplete on the input for this. if can't find a way to make user add the country on a simple way just remove it

- add the imperial/metric toggle
- carbon copy the app design. use excalidraw font, either find fitting icons or draw them and use them
- light/dark theme toggle (need to change icons color too, scrap this if it's not possible)
- add auto completion on the text input
